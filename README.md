# Machine-Learning-material

A repository I created to store learned info and practices on the application and concepts of machine learning which includes:

*#Python #Jupyter Notebook*

> Unsupervised Learning (decides that the data can be assigned to two different groups or two different clusters | Automatically finds structure in data)
 - Clustering (Takes data without labels and tries to automatcally group them into clusters | *ex: Google News*)
 - Anomaly Detection (Finds unusual data points)
 - Dimensionality reduction (Compress data using fewer numbers)

> Supervised Learning (Learning Input, Output, or X to Y mappings)
 - Linear Regression (Regression Algorithms learn to predict numbers out of many possible numbers)
 - Classification (*different from regression*, Classification treis to predict any number , all of the infintely many number of possible numbers | two possible outputs.
                   It may have more than two ouput posiible categories.)
