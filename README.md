# Machine-Learning-material

A repository I created to store learned info and practices on the application and concepts of machine learning which includes:

*#Python #JupyterNotebook*

> Unsupervised Learning (decides that the data can be assigned to two different groups or two different clusters | Automatically finds structure in data)

 - Clustering (Takes data without labels and tries to automatcally group them into clusters | *ex: Google News*)
 
 - Anomaly Detection (Finds unusual data points)
 
 - Dimensionality reduction (Compress data using fewer numbers)

> Supervised Learning (Learning Input, Output, or X to Y mappings)

 - Linear Regression (Regression Algorithms learn to predict numbers out of many possible numbers| *ex: Cost Function*)
 
 - Classification (*different from regression*, Classification tries to predict any number , all of the infinitely many number of possible numbers | two possible outputs. It may have more than two ouput possible categories.)
 
 - Gradient Descent (optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function (cost)| It is used to train machine learning models and neural networks)

 - Logistic Regression


## Specialization skills: 

• Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.

• Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression.

• Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.

• Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.

• Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.

• Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.

• Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.

• Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
